This repository contains the contents of my midterm project for CEN4802C- Software integration, configuration and testing, as well as for the final project which added onto the midterm.

My project uses a simple fibonacci Java program built with Maven and deployed on a Jenkins Maven pipeline.

Some tools and features I integrated:
- Git for version control.
- Docker for application deployment.
- Jenkins for CI/CD.
- JUnit for unit testing.
- DataDog for monitoring.
- JMeter for lightweight testing upon updating in Jenkins.
- `java.util.logging` for logging application data.
- `javax.mail` for automated delivery of logs to relevant team members.

Both sets of notes used during the presentations are available in this repository.
